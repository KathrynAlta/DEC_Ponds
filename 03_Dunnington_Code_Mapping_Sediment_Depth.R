# 6. TIN --> required packages not availale for this version of R 
   # triangular irregular network surface (TIN) connects points using a Delaunay triangulation (a network of triangles as round as
   # possible) and approximates each triangle as a plane. It results in contours that are pointier than you may be hoping for, but 
   # doesnâ€™t predict any values higher or lower than you measured and is a good reality check on any other method as its main 
   # assumption is that you bothered to take a depth measurement anywhere that it mattered.
